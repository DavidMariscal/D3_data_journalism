          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>According to the chart we can deduce, that living in a poor community makes you less likely to live a long life. 
            The evidence suggests that living in a community with high income inequality also seems to be bad for the health.</p>

          <p>It is not just the level of income in a community that matters, itâ€™s also how income is distributed. Many factors 
            besides inequality affect health, for example, how much people smoke, whether they are obese, and the safety of air
            and water, among many other factors, make a difference.</p>

          <p>But the effect of inequality was statistically significant, there is a difference of about several days of life 
            between high and low inequality places. The differences were small, but for every increment that a community became 
            more unequal, there are relationships between income inequality and life expectancy among countries in the world.</p>
